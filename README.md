ðŸ©º Multiple Disease Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-powered web application developed using Python and Streamlit, designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease based on user health inputs. By integrating multiple models into a single interface, this system offers a consolidated platform for early risk assessment and healthcare awareness.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features

âœ… Predicts multiple diseases (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinsonâ€™s) in one unified platform.

âœ… Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn for preprocessing and model development.

âœ… Intuitive Streamlit-based web application that provides a clean and interactive user experience.

âœ… Delivers real-time predictions to support quick and informed health-related decisions.

âœ… Encourages preventive healthcare practices by making ML predictions easily accessible.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

The application collects basic medical parameters (such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, heart rate, etc.) and passes them to pre-trained ML models. Each model outputs a prediction, which is then displayed in the web app. Users can check their risk factors instantly without needing in-depth technical knowledge.

This project highlights the practical application of Data Science and Machine Learning in the healthcare domain, focusing on accessibility, usability, and preventive health awareness.
